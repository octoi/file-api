# FILE API

A simple file api made using rust ðŸ“‚

| Folder Name | Function                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| api         | contains code for file-api                       |
| files       | all files will be saved in that folder           |
| test-site   | a simple website for testing the upload endpoint |

Run server to get a server at http://localhost:8080 with two routes:

- `POSTÂ /upload` \- you can upload a file here
- `GET /files/*` - download the uploaded files

The file is saved using a random id as a name, with the extension. The name is logged, so you can see that it worked.

The max file-size is configured at ~100 MB.
